					As I approach the final week, I find myself immersed in a whirlwind of reflections. Time has flown by at an astonishing pace, leaving me marveling at the journey from the nascent days of the semester to this moment. The lessons learned, the growth experienced â€“ it's been a semester of profound transformation. Even the encounters with challenging professors, upon retrospection, have revealed themselves as catalysts for my personal and academic evolution. In hindsight, every trial and triumph has woven together to form a tapestry of invaluable experience that I wouldn't alter for the world.

					One of the most enriching aspects of this semester has been the cultivation of meaningful connections. I've fostered deeper friendships in these few months than I ever imagined possible during my tenure at OSU. This semester carries a unique significance as I set forth on the path towards graduation, scheduled for December 2024. Reflecting on my initial days on campus, I recall the sense of disorientation as I navigated a different academic terrain. While my journey commenced in electrical engineering, my heart found its true calling in computer science. The transition has been liberating, leading to a sense of fulfillment that surpasses any previous academic pursuit.

					We find ourselves amidst turbulent times, especially in the pursuit of employment opportunities. Nevertheless, I remain optimistic about discovering a role that not only harnesses my potential but also nurtures continuous growth and learning. As the prospect of graduation looms closer, I embrace the uncertainty with a steadfast belief in the possibilities that await.

					Among the myriad blessings of this semester, my internship stands out as a beacon of enlightenment. The camaraderie shared with my colleagues, coupled with their unwavering support, has provided invaluable insights into the realm of design. What began as a professional endeavor has evolved into a journey of self-discovery, as I uncover layers of creativity and innovation previously dormant within me.
