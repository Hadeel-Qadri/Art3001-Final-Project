  <div class="first_div"> I am currently engaged in the process of learning JavaScript, and while I have made progress, I must admit that I haven't delved deeply into the intricacies 
    of event listening. However, I am aware that mastering this aspect is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of JavaScript's functionality. In my pursuit of proficiency, 
    I strongly believe that structured exercises tailored to various aspects of JavaScript would greatly enhance my learning experience. I am convinced that by thoroughly immersing 
    myself in these exercises, I can develop a solid foundation and confidently navigate through the complexities of the language.</div>
  <div class="second_div">The functionality offered by the p5 library is undeniably fascinating, presenting a myriad of creative possibilities. However, I recognize the importance of 
    having a solid foundation in JavaScript to fully comprehend how p5 operates. As I delve into learning p5, I am intrigued by its potential for creating visually captivating 
    drawings and interactive experiences. In particular, I believe that its application in education holds immense promise, providing a unique opportunity to teach coding concepts 
    to children in an engaging and accessible manner. Utilizing p5 in educational settings not only facilitates the learning of programming principles but also nurtures creativity 
    and problem-solving skills. By enabling students to visually express their ideas through code, p5 can demystify abstract concepts and foster a deeper understanding of 
    computational thinking. Moreover, the interactive nature of p5 projects encourages collaborative learning and experimentation, making it an invaluable tool for educators seeking 
    to cultivate a passion for technology in their students.</div>
  <div class="third_div">  Moreover, while I am intrigued by the p5 library and its potential applications, I am also mindful of the importance of mastering JavaScript fundamentals 
    before venturing into more specialized domains. As I see it, JavaScript can be approached at multiple levels, each offering its own set of challenges and opportunities for 
    growth. Therefore, I am eager to explore these different levels and deepen my understanding of JavaScript's capabilities.</div>
